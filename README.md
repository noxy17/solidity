# solidity

# Objective: Develop a smart contract in Solidity for managing student grades.

# Requirements:

# Structs: Define a struct named Grade with fields studentName, subject, and grade to store student grade information.

# Array: Utilize an array to store instances of the Grade struct, representing grades for multiple students.

# Modifiers: Implement a modifier named onlyOwner to restrict functions (e.g., adding or updating grades) to be accessible only by the contract owner.

# Constructor: Create a constructor to initialize the contract owner (instructor) 
# Functions:

# addGrade: Function to add a new grade entry for a student.
# updateGrade: Function to update the grade of a student for a specific subject.
# getGrade: Function to retrieve the grade of a student for a particular subject.
# averageGrade: Function to calculate and return the average grade of all students for a specific subject.

# Instructions:
# Use the provided structure and functionalities to develop the contract using Solidity.
# Ensure that only the contract owner (instructor) can modify grade entries using the onlyOwner modifier.
# Test the contract thoroughly to ensure accurate functionality in storing, updating, retrieving, and calculating  student grades.
